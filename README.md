# EloZone
Chess-like Elo system for the NFL
## About
EloZone is an open-source data project that provides chess-like elo ratings for NFL teams. A teams elo rating is calculated after each game, their change in elo is based on their opponents rating, the result of the game, and the score differential.

Example: A 21-0 game will result in a larger rating swing than a 14-10 game.

## Live Results
Live results can be found on both the EloZone [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/elozone.bsky.social) and [X](https://x.com/EloZoneNFL) pages.
